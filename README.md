 Code used for Pooled Testing in HIV paper

This project contains all of the code used to produce the results in the paper titled "Prediction-Driven Pooled Testing Methods: Application to HIV Treatment Monitoring in Kalisizo, Uganda".

Below are descriptions of programs, documentation and datasets used on this project.

Data Dictionary:
  The data dictionary is an Excel workbook with a separate sheet for the datasets included in this repository. The dictionary for each dataset contains a row for each variable in that dataset and the source for the variable. If it is a derived variable it also includes the derivation for that variable. The datasets include the simulation datasets used in Section 4 as well as the raw, intermediate and final datasets containing real-world data from Uganda used in Section 5. The raw dataset from Uganda is not included in the repository.
